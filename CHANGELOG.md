# Changelog

All notable changes to `kgsm-auth` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`TheKrystalShip.KGSM.Auth.Users`** — KGSM owns identity. A local account is the primary object:
  it exists on its own, carries the tier, and an external provider becomes one way to prove you are
  an account KGSM already knows about rather than the source of one.
  - `KgsmUser` / `UserStatus` / `TierSource`: the account, whether it may be used, and whether its
    tier was granted by an admin or derived from a mapping. An account that is not active resolves
    to `None` whatever is written on it.
  - `UserCredential` / `CredentialKind`: what proves an account — a local password, a linked
    external identity, and a typed column so a third kind costs a row rather than a migration. One
    unique index on the handle both stops an identity being linked to two accounts and holds an
    account to a single password.
  - `IUserStore` / `SqliteUserStore`: a host-level SQLite file at `/var/lib/kgsm/auth/users.db`, `0600`,
    WAL with a busy timeout, read and written directly by every surface on the host so no leaf
    depends on a sibling to authenticate anyone. Schema changes are additive only, the file carries
    a `schema_version`, and a store written by a newer build is refused rather than half read.
  - `LocalSignInService`: username and password, with an unknown username and a wrong password
    giving one answer at one cost, exponential per-account lockout, and rehash-on-upgrade so a
    change of hash format migrates accounts as their owners sign in.
  - `UserStoreAuthority`: the `IAuthorityProvider` that answers from the account. An identity linked
    to nobody holds nothing; a store that cannot be read is an outage and never a denial.
  - `IUserPasswordHasher` / `IdentityPasswordHasher`: `PasswordHasher<T>` behind a seam, so the hash
    format can be replaced without a forced reset.

### Changed

- **Identity is provider-agnostic.** `KgsmIdentity(Provider, Subject, …)` replaces `DiscordIdentity`
  across the shared packages, and `Auth.Sessions` no longer references `Auth.Discord` at all — the
  token layer mints and reads whatever provider a host signed someone in through. A session subject is
  `provider:subject`, which for a Discord login is the same `discord:<id>` string as before, so no
  issued token or stored session row changes meaning.
- **Who someone is and what they may do are separate seams.** `IIdentityProvider` verifies an identity;
  `IAuthorityProvider` resolves the tier it holds; `ISignInService`/`SignInService` compose the two, so
  either can be replaced without touching the other or the login path. `DiscordDirectory` implements
  both, and `IDiscordDirectory` is gone.
- **`OAuthHandshake` and the tier cache moved into the dependency-free core** (`KgsmTierCache`,
  keyed by the provider-qualified handle). Neither was ever Discord's: the state+PKCE handshake is a
  property of the authorization-code flow, and a per-user tier cache is a property of re-deriving
  authority.
- **`DiscordAuthException` derives from `KgsmAuthProviderException`**, so a caller that treats any
  provider's outage the same way catches the base type and knows nothing about Discord.
- **`KgsmActor.Discord` is removed** — `KgsmIdentity.ActorString` builds the same `provider:username`
  string from the identity that already knows its provider.

### Added

- **`TheKrystalShip.KGSM.Auth.Sessions`** — session tokens and the storage seam.
  - `SessionTokenService`: HMAC-SHA256 access + refresh JWTs, `sid` stable across rotation, a fresh
    `jti` per mint. Lifetimes and issuer are settings, so one value drives both the token's expiry and
    the registry row's, and a surface that already mints keeps its issuer rather than 401ing every
    live token.
  - `ISessionRegistry` / `SessionRegistration`: create, liveness, rotate-with-reuse-detection, revoke,
    GC. Storage is each surface's own.
  - `SessionValidator`: the cached per-request check. Absolute expiry, denials cached, namespaced keys.
  - `SessionCleanupWorker`: startup catch-up pass plus a timer; a failed sweep never kills the worker.

- **`TheKrystalShip.KGSM.Auth.Discord`** — the ecosystem's single chokepoint to `discord.com`.
  - `IDiscordDirectory` / `DiscordDirectory`: the OAuth exchange, `/users/@me` identity verification,
    and the bot-token guild-role lookup that resolves a tier. Not-a-member, a member with no roles,
    and a failed lookup stay three distinct answers.
  - `OAuthHandshake`: CSRF `state` + PKCE verifier in one HttpOnly cookie, so a surface runs PKCE with
    no server-side pending store and the state is bound to the browser that started the login.
  - `DiscordTierCache`: short-TTL per-user tier cache for surfaces that re-derive authority per
    request. Caches denials too.

## [1.0.0]

### Added

- `TheKrystalShip.KGSM.Auth` — the shared authorization model, dependency-free and AOT-safe.
  - `KgsmTier` / `KgsmTiers`: the ordered viewer/operator/admin ladder and its wire form, with
    fail-closed parsing.
  - `KgsmRoleMap`: Discord role ids → tier. Guild membership is the access gate; a verified member
    floors at viewer. `Resolve` for string snowflakes, `ResolveSnowflakes` for the numeric form a
    gateway client holds.
  - `KgsmAuthOptions`: the `KgsmAuth` configuration section every surface binds.
  - `KgsmAuthClaims` / `KgsmTokenKind` / `KgsmRelayHeaders`: session claim and relay header names.
  - `KgsmActor` / `KgsmActorProvider`: the `provider:name` actor convention.
