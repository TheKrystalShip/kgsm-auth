/// <para>
/// The stream alone is not enough. A member joins on Tuesday and the changes that happened on Monday

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Ordering with the stream needs no coordination.</b> Both paths carry the same per-account
/// version and the replica refuses anything not newer, so a change landing while the snapshot is
/// being applied is safe whichever order the two arrive in. That is what makes "snapshot, then
/// follow" a sequence rather than a handover.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>It keeps trying until it succeeds, and then stops.</b> The holder may be unreachable, may not
/// be assigned yet, or may be this member itself; none of those is an error, and none is permanent.
/// Once a snapshot has been taken from a given holder this worker is done — the stream carries
/// everything after it, and re-reading the whole set on a timer would be a poll standing in for a
/// push that already works.
